# 🌱 Super Absorbent Polymers in Agriculture

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the **use of Super Absorbent Polymers (SAPs)** in agriculture, focusing on their ability to **retain water**, **slowly release nutrients**, and **improve soil conditions** for sustainable farming.

## 🧪 Key Concepts

### 🌊 Water Retention Mechanism
- SAPs absorb water via ionization of hydrophilic groups (–COOH, –OH, –NH₂).
- Expand through internal electrostatic repulsion.
- Gradually release water to plants as soil dries out.

### 🧫 Slow-Release Mechanism
- Encapsulate fertilizers and release them as water diffuses out.
- Reduce leaching and enhance nutrient efficiency.
- Improve root health and reduce irrigation cycles.
